# To sort a file:
sort <file>

# To sort a file by keeping only unique:
sort -u <file>

# To sort a file and reverse the result:
sort -r <file>

# To sort a file randomly:
sort -R <file>

# To sort a file and store the output in another file:
sort <inputFile> -o <outputFile>

# Sort by default uses /var/tmp to store temp files but size of /var/tmp directory is limited. In order to sort huge use a directory with adequate size:
sort -T <tempDirectory> <file>

# sort by column
# aa.txt:
# tom  30
# jimmy 40
sort -k2 -n aa.txt 

# a.txt contains "1 2 3", b.txt contains "2 3 4"

# ==1. subtract 2 sets. a.txt - b.txt. print '1'
sort a.txt  b.txt b.txt | uniq -u # -u: only print items that appear ==1

# >=1. union a.txt and b.txt
sort a.txt b.txt | uniq #  print '1 2 3 4'

# >= 2. intersect 2 sets.
sort a.txt b.txt | uniq -d # -d: only print items that appear >= 2
